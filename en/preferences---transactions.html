The cost types are used to categorize the costs and fees recorded to transactions: for example, transaction cost types can include advisory fees, custodian fees or broker commissions.</p><p>Transaction cost types can be defined in the Transaction cost types window in the Preferences. A cost type consists of a name and a type: the name is used to view and choose the type in the user interface and the type is used to identify the cost type.</p><p>In addition, you can categorize your transaction cost types, allowing you to associate a category to each of your transaction cost types. You can categorize your transaction cost types as Portfolio (investment service costs), Security (product costs) or 3rd (third party payments), and then further as Not categorized (default), One-off charges, On-going charges, Charges related to transactions, Charges related to ancillary services or Incidental charges, or from up to five additional Other cost categories. Cost category of a transaction cost type is utilized in ex-post cost analysis: when a category is set to a transaction cost type, the amount of the cost is summed into the selected cost category. For example, you can categorize the brokerage fees you record on your transactions as Charges related to transactions., when the amount of brokerage fee you enter into your transaction is considered as charges related to transactions in ex-post cost reporting.</p></section><section dir="ltr" class="section" data-origin-id="" data-legacy-id="UUID-7353f384-b30e-cdd8-122d-f74a0fc0b073_transaction-types" data-publication-date="" id="transaction-types"><div class="titlepage"><div><div class="title"><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">Transaction types</h2></div></div></div><p>Transaction type preferences allow you to see the transaction types available in the system together with the characteristics and effects of the defined transaction types. Transaction types are relevant when creating transactions: the transaction type selected for a transaction determines what kind of a combination of effects the transaction has on the portfolio.</p><p>For example, a transaction type "Sell" has a positive cash effect (e.g. money is deposited to portfolio's account with the transaction), negative amount and FIFO effects (e.g. a sell reduces the amount of the security in the portfolio), a sell would realize profits or losses and finally, taxes and costs reduce the trade amount of a sell (e.g. when there is a cost recorded to a sell of a security, the cost is deducted from the original trade amount and reduces the money you will actually get from the sell).</p><div dir="ltr" class="note"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>Do not modify the standard transaction types' effects - instead, create a new transaction type and use one of the existing types as an example. Transaction type effects often work as a combination, and changing one and not the other might not have a desirable outcome - avoid making your own combinations.</p></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="image/uuid-a32e80df-2e50-5e0b-fcb7-49715dcf47c0.png" style="" alt="preferences-transaction_types.png"></img></div><p>Transaction types are defined with the basic information of the transaction type (code and name) and through relevant effects for each transaction type. When creating a new transaction type, effects are by default No effect or similar.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Type code*</span></dt><dd><p>Unique transaction type code that separates it from other transaction types.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Short name*</span></dt><dd><p>Short name for the transaction type, which is used in the reports as the abbreviation of the transaction type. Transaction's short name can be translated into different languages, while the transaction type's type code is used to identify the transaction types within the system and cannot be translated.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Name*</span></dt><dd><p>Name of the transaction type.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Cash effect</span></dt><dd><p>Choose from No effect, Adds cash or Reduces cash. The cash effect describes the effect the transaction has on the cash balance of the account linked to the transaction. For example, a "Buy" transaction reduces cash and a "Sell" adds cash on the portfolio's account by the trade amount of the transaction.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Net effect</span></dt><dd><p>Choose from No effect, Add or Reduce. The net effect affects the transaction's net cash flow to the portfolio. If there is no net cash flow on the transaction, then any effect the transaction has on the market value of the portfolio will affect the portfolio's performance (TWR). Net effect would counter these effects otherwise. The net effect works differently depending on the transaction type's cash effect: when the transaction doesn't have cash effect, then the net cash flow is directly depending on net effect and transaction's trade amount (for example, "Add" transaction type has the net effect "add" =&gt; positive net cash flow, and "Remove" transaction type has the net effect "reduce" =&gt; negative net cash flow). However, if the transaction also has a cash effect, the net cash flow of the transaction is the combination of the cash and net effects: "add" cash and net effects =&gt; positive net cash flow; "add" cash but "reduce" net effect =&gt; negative net cash flow; "reduce" cash but "add" net effect =&gt; negative net cash flow; "reduce" cash and net effects =&gt; positive net cash flow. For example, "Withdrawal" transaction type has the cash effect of "reduce" and the net effect "add", which results in a negative net cash flow effect.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Amount effect</span></dt><dd><p>Choose from No effect, Adds amount or Reduces amount. The amount effect describes the effect of the transaction's amount (i.e. units) on the amount of the security in the portfolio. For example, a "Buy" transaction adds amount and a "Sell" reduces amount of a position by the amount of the transaction.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">FIFO</span></dt><dd><p>Choose from No effect, Add, Reduce or Reduce all. FIFO describes whether the FIFO valuation method is taken into account. "No effect" means that the valuation method is not taken into account. "Add" means that the transaction is "in" and adds the amount of the security. "Reduce" means that the transaction is "out" and reduces the amount of the security. "Reduce all" means that the transaction is "out" and reduces the amount of each purchase lot proportionally.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Return effect</span></dt><dd><p>Choose from No effect, Adds return (profit) or Reduces return (cost). The return effect describes the effect of the transaction on the portfolio return. For example, a "Dividend" transaction adds return. From FA 3.9 onward, return effect determines whether a transaction is a profit (adds return) or a cost (reduces return). This allows you to explicitly control "Other profits" and "Other costs" in TWR calculation. For example, a "Dividend" transaction adds return and is considered as "Other profits". In addition, you can control for example where you want see the effect of kickbacks - even with positive cashflow, you can configure your kickbacks to reduce return (a cost), when kickbacks would increase your (negative) costs instead of reducing your (positive) returns.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Realized profit effect</span></dt><dd><p>Choose from No effect, Realize profits/losses, Realize profits/losses by closing open positions or Realize profit indirectly. The profit effect defines, whether the transaction realizes profits - Realize profits/losses calculates realized profits from the transaction, such as sell, and shows it as “realized profit” and as “capital gain” for taxation purposes, while Realize profits/losses indirectly calculates realized profits from the transaction, and shows it only as “realized profit” but not as "capital gain". For example, a "Sell" transaction realizes profits (shown realized profits from performance's point of view and as capital gains for taxation purposes), while a "Remove" transaction realizes profits indirectly (shown as realized profit from performance's point of view but not as capital gains on tax reports). From FA 3.9 onward, the effect "Realize profits/losses" works on its own, independent of other effects. This allows you to realize profits also when your position’s units don’t change, not only when buying or selling.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Purchase price effect</span></dt><dd><p>Choose the purchase price effect from the alternatives. Purchase price effect allows you to adjust your position's purchase price directly with your transaction's trade amount, even when your transaction doesn't have an amount effect. For example, transactions such as "capital return", "value adjustments" at year-end and "mark-to-market" for futures' handling often have a purchase price effect, only affecting your position's purchase value. For example "buy" and "sell" transactions don't have a separate purchase price effect, since they affect the position through the amount effect.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul style="list-style-type: disc; " class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>"No effect" - transaction's trade amount has no direct effect on the purchase price of the position.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>"Add", "Add, record orig values", "Add in security currency", "Add in security currency, record orig values", "Add and set fx" and "Add and set fx, record orig values" - transaction's trade amount adds the position's trade amount in different ways. These options allow you to manage "value adjustments" at year-end for bookkeeping or "mark-to-market" on your futures' positions even for non-portfolio currency securities.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>"Reduce", "Reduce, record orig values", "Reduce in security currency", "Reduce in security currency, record orig values", "Reduce and set fx" and "Reduce and set fx, record orig values" -transaction's trade amount reduces the position's trade amount in different ways. These options allow you to manage "capital returns", "value adjustments" at year-end for bookkeeping or "mark-to-market" on your futures' positions even for non-portfolio currency securities.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>"Keep original purchase price", "Keep original purchase time" and "Keep original purchase price and time" - allows you to keep your position's original purchase times and values when changing a position to another. These allow you to maintain your FIFO chain and values for example for "exchanges" (keep original purchase time) or "subscriptions" when the new shares's purchase value is combined with existing lots (keep original purchase price).</p></li></ul></div></dd><dt><span class="term">Purchase price profit effect</span></dt><dd><p>Choose from No effect, Unrealized profit or Realizes negative purchase lots. Only available when transaction type has a “Purchase unit price effect”. Controls whether adding or reducing purchase price affects unrealized profits. This allows you to control TWR calculation: value adjustments for accounting purposes don't change “original” purchase value and thus don’t affect TWR, while capital returns change purchase value from TWR’s point of view. (Available from FA 3.9 onward)</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul style="list-style-type: disc; " class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>No effect - purchase value is changed, but the “original” trade amount is not changed. Therefore, the unrealized profits in TWR are not affected.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Unrealized profit - also the “original trade amount” is affected and therefore the unrealized profits as well. In addition, if there is a difference in FX rates, which is possible if adding / reducing purchase value is done "in security currency" or with "set FX", the difference due to the FX rates is booked separately as "Realized FX profit".</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Realizes negative purchase lots - same as the previous, but if purchase value is reduced with any of the "Reduce" effects AND the purchase value on a purchase lot would go negative, the negative part is recorded as realized profit. This effect is only used for “Capital return” transactions in Finland.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Unrealized profit via cost - affects the "original trade amount" of the buy transaction to which the cost is linked. Used, for example, for a legal fee that is added as a separate transaction ("Transaction cost" transaction type). The fee transaction must have the same Amount as the Buy transaction (to create a link between these tranasactions). The fee's Trade amount is added to the "original trade amount" of the buy transaction.</p></li></ul></div></dd><dt><span class="term">Market price effect</span></dt><dd><p>Сhoose from No effect, Adds market value or Reduces market value. Market price effect allows you to adjust your position's market value directly with your transaction's trade amount. This is useful if you don't get daily market prices on your securities, and want to instead adjust the market value of your position directly with transactions, for example for "Private Equity" and "real estate" investments. If you feed market prices on your security, transactions with market price effect has no effect on your position.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Cost category group</span></dt><dd><p>Сhoose a cost category group for your transaction from Portfolio (investment service costs), Security (product costs) or 3rd (third party payments). Within each group, select a further cost category from the next field.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Cost category</span></dt><dd><p>Сhoose a cost category for your transaction from Not categorized (default), One-off charges, On-going charges, Charges related to transactions, Charges related to ancillary services or Incidental charges, or from up to five additional Other cost categories. Cost category of a cost transaction is utilized in ex-post cost analysis: when a category is set to a cost transaction, the trade amount of such a transaction is summed into the selected cost category. For example, you can categorize your asset management fees as On-going charges, when the trade amount of your asset management fee transaction is considered as on-going charges in ex-post cost reporting.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Date effect</span></dt><dd><p>Сhoose from Effect on position on transaction date to Effect on position on settlement date. The date effect allows you to decide whether you transaction affects your portfolios positions on the defined effective transaction date (booked date if defined, otherwise transaction date) or on the defined settlement date. By default transactions have an effect on position on transaction date, but changing the effect on position on settlement date is especially useful for example when the effect of a deposit or withdrawal should not be shown on your bank account before the settlement date, allowing you to directly track the settled, actual available cash within your portfolio. If you configure your transactions to take effect on the settlement date, the transaction will affect all calculations, including positions, profits and other analysis, only from the settlement date onward.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Ratio effect</span></dt><dd><p>Choose from No effect or Relative effect on amount and unit price. The ration effect defines, whether the Ratio field of the Transaction window is available (no effect -&amp;gt; field not in use), and what kind of an effect the value in the field has on the security's amount and unit price.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Security 2</span></dt><dd><p>Security 2 defines if the transaction type has another security in addition to the security chosen in the transaction.

The number of removed units is based on the transaction ratio. If the second security is not removed entirely, the remaining purchase lots are left untouched. This effect is used in exchange transactions. For example, if you have 3 units and exchange them with a ratio 2 to 1, you will get one new unit, and one old unit is left in your portfolio.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>“Removes 2nd security entirely” - All second security units are removed from the portfolio. For example, if you have 3 units and exchange them with a ratio 2 to 1, you will get one new unit and one remaining old unit is rounded away so that all old units are removed.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>"Removes 2nd security and transfer cost" - All second security units are removed from the portfolio. All the costs and cashflows are transferred to the underlying security. The effect is used for exercising call and put option with the EXCC and EXCP transactions. This effect makes sure that the underlying cash flows and purchase value is considered correctly i.e. canceling out the cashflows when exercised.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>“Based on another security” - Transaction involves another security, and the transaction effects determine how it is what the effect is. For example, issues are based on your ownership of the second security.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>“Based on another security, transfer return” – Transaction has a second security. This effect keeps the old position in the portfolio and reduces the purchase price of the old position by the equivalent of the trade amount in the transaction. For the transaction date, the market value is split between the old and new position with the same percentage share as purchase value was transferred. This effect makes sure that the analytics values (Market value, TWR, cashflows) are preserved in spin-offs, where the removed security is first exchanged to a "temporary security" and the temporary security is exchanged back to the original security with a new exchange corporate action.</p></li></ul></div></dd><dt><span class="term">Group</span></dt><dd><p>Сhoose from No, Yes - same or Yes - opposite.
